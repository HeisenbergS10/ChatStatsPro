# ChatStatsPro

ChatStatsPro is a powerful tool designed to process and analyze WhatsApp chat data, helping investigators identify key patterns, sentiments, and critical conversations. When used in cases involving suicide victims, it can assist in uncovering signs of distress, identifying possible triggers, and detecting communication with relevant individuals. By leveraging sentiment analysis, keyword tracking, and behavioral patterns, this tool can provide valuable insights to support investigations and mental health assessments.
